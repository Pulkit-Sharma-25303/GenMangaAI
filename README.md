# GenManga AI: Manga Generator
GenManga AI is a user-friendly web app that lets anyone create their own manga panels using cutting-edge AI. Built from a passion for both manga and artificial intelligence, this tool empowers storytellers, artists, and fans to rapidly generate professional manga imagery, maintain character consistency, add speech bubbles, and assemble complete pages—all without the need for coding or design experience.

Features
Text-to-Manga Panel Generation: Describe a scene in plain language and let the AI create stunning manga panels.

Character Consistency: Keep your characters visually consistent across scenes and expressions.

Speech Bubble Integration: Add custom dialogue to panels with flexible bubble placement.

Collage Builder: Arrange multiple panels into fully composed manga pages with a single click.

Intuitive Streamlit Interface: Easy-to-use, visually appealing UI—no coding required.

Demo

Quick Start
1. Clone This Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genmanga-ai.git
cd genmanga-ai
2. Set Up Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment: bash python -m venv genmanga_env source genmanga_env/bin/activate  # or .\genmanga_env\Scripts\activate on Windows
3. Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Download or Prepare Your Model
Fine-tune or download your preferred Stable Diffusion model and place it in the genmanga_model directory within your project folder.
See instructions below on using Google Colab for fast model preparation.
5. Run the App
streamlit run manga_generator_app.py
How It Works
GenManga AI leverages:
Stable Diffusion (via HuggingFace Diffusers) for panel generation
CLIP for character consistency detection
Streamlit for the frontend web app
PIL (Pillow) for image manipulation and speech bubbles
Model caching and local loading for fast startup
You can generate panels by simply entering a prompt, style, and character details, then assemble your story visually.
Prepare Your Model in Google Colab
To avoid slow model downloads at runtime, train or fine-tune your model in Google Colab and export it:
Open a Colab notebook.
Install dependencies:
!pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors
Load (and optionally fine-tune) your model, then save it to Google Drive:
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive")
model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")
pipe.save_pretrained("/content/drive/MyDrive/genmanga_model")
Download the genmanga_model directory from Google Drive and place it in your local project folder.

Sample Usage
Enter your character description, manga style, expression, and scene prompt.
Click "Generate Panel" to see the image.
Add speech bubbles with custom dialogue.
Create a collage to visualize a manga page.
Download your creations to share or print.

Troubleshooting
Models loading slowly? Train and save your model via Google Colab or ensure your local system uses SSD storage.
Memory errors? Use lower resolution or ensure you have at least 16GB RAM; for heavy use, 32GB is recommended.
"File not found": Ensure you've placed genmanga_model in the correct location and all model files are present.
